abstract: Positive schooling is the positive psychological movement that calls for the incorporation of student well-being as a focus of the learning environment. A strength-based approach to positive schooling employs character strengths as a pathway to positive change and well-being. The scoping review aimed to systematically review and map the strength-based positive schooling interventions that have been conducted thus far on adolescent students. It has been performed using the five-stage theoretical framework proposed by Arksey and O’Malley. The present scoping review has identified 13 such studies, and examined the program design, outcomes, and theoretical underpinnings. Despite mixed intervention results, this paper highlights that strength-based positive schooling interventions produce promising positive outcomes in student well-being and positive emotions. The study also identified a need for evidence of the long-term effectiveness of these interventions, whole-school approaches, and theory building in positive schooling and education.
